title: Psychological safety for thinking strategically
---

In this post, I would like to share with you a bit of my personal experience and development thanks to Manager Development Experience (MDE) program by adidas.
I was lucky enough to be selected to participate in this program that I started about 9 months ago and thanks to this initiative, I´ve met, learn and work with smart and brilliant people from different departments in adidas, people which I´d probably  never have the opportunity to interact with in a daily work, and this interaction made me realize how lucky I am to be part of this company and be surrounded by such talented people in all areas.

## Psychological safety

During this journey I´ve learnt and consolidate knowledge about how the brain works, this is an area that I have always be interested in and I learnt by myself in the past, but during this program I felt I was connecting the dots from my previous learnings and how to apply this knowledge in my daily work.
It has been demonstrated that your emotional state can change the perception of the world and the performance of your brain, and how important it is to feel confident and psychologically safe in order to perform at the highest level.

### But what exactly is psychological safety and why it is important?
Well, from my understanding it means you believe that you will not be punished if you make a mistake. 
Having this believe and confidence can push you to take risks and actions that can end up in extraordinary results, speaking up and sharing “crazy” ideas, that can lead you or your team to do things differently with unexpected and extraordinary results.
On the other hand, if you don´t feel psychologically safe and, for instance, you get a bad comment from your colleagues or your manager, your brain could interpret this as a threat.
Under these circumstances, your amygdala will block your rational brain and move your body resources from your brain to other body organs, like muscles, lung and heart. 
This behavior has a survival nature behind, as in human history this was effective when an individual was facing a threat, like being surprised by a predator, so staying there starting to think did not get any advantage for survival, but running faster than ever before or being able  to jump higher into a tree did increase the probability of survive. 
The problem is that the world has evolved faster that our brain, and the amygdala behavior is still the same as in the past when nowadays you feel a threat because, for instance, you are stuck with a task, a college/boss bad comment, or when you cannot achieve a deadline, so in the moment you need more your rational brain, it is not there.

### How can this be avoided?
Creating a psychologically safe environment is a task of everyone in the team, but from my point of view it has more weight in people in the managing levels as we are the ones that can share this with the team and respond without punishment but motivation and improvement points to failures. I strongly believe It is a good practice to share this with your team, so everybody is aware of it. Fortunately, I´ve feel this psychological safety in my team since the beginning, and this is something that I try to transmit to everyone in my team, specially to new joiners or candidates, as I know this can make everybody feel more comfortable and at the same time, perform better.



## Thinking Strategically

The other big point I realized was important for my development and where I focused thanks to MDE is “Thinking strategically”. 
I´ve work for almost 20 years as Software Engineer in different companies, but my main focus was almost always to get my tasks done, help others and attend to the meetings I had trying to contribute with my ideas, but without questioning why I was doing that.
Now, with this new perspective provided by MDE where one of my points of improvement was Thinking Strategically, I´ve change my perspective while I´ve started applying the learnings:

### Start with... WHY?
Now, everything I do at work, like attending to meetings, prepare tasks, work on concrete tasks or whatever I´m about to do, I try to answer these questions before starting:
Why am I/we doing this?
Why is this important?
Why does it make sense? Or why does in not make any sense?
Why are we doing this that way instead of this other?
Why am I attending this meeting?
Why should I do this task first?

Making this question has helped me realize the reason why something is important for the team and the company, why these tasks provide value and how they align with the company strategy.
Having this new vision allows me to prioritize better, and in some cases, challenge the team to decide if a concrete task or milestone should be modified, done now, later or even never do it.

As consequence of knowing why things needs to be done, we are **providing clarity**, the team has a better vision to decide on what needs to be done and how needs to be done, as we understand the purpose of it because we know the why.

### Evaluating different scenarios ###
Other important point of this strategical thinking I´ve started to develop is **evaluating different scenarios**, think in the benefits and drawbacks, and somehow create a mental plan for each one, that way you can work proactively towards these scenarios, so you are better prepared when the scenario changes. 

### Conclusion ###
As a quick summary of my experience and development, I´ve started to do things outside my comfort zone, take a step back in my daily tasks to change my perspective towards a more strategic, transversal vision, and this is something that I could never had done if I didn´t felt the psychological safety in my team.
